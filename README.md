this is a port/clone of the game pickin sticks in java,its kind of  a hello world for game programing.
its built using my slick2d framework that can be found here:


https://github.com/yoel123/yoel-java-slick2d-framework

the raw code is inside "raw code" folder.
the eclipse project is in "eclipse exports", to see the tuts in action use export all.
to create your own peoject export blank_project.
